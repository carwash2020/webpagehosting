# Bug-fix specialist log

Started 2026-09-16, alongside the `tripleh-bugfix` skill. See `README.md` in
this directory for how these logs work.

One seed entry, carried over from before this log existed: the full local
test suite has a known, pre-existing gap in
`tests/workspace/finance-split.test.js` — its "fix-versions actually
corrects a real mismatch" test deliberately writes a wrong version stamp
into the real `tools/workspace.html`, runs the real `fix-versions` script
against the real repo to fix it, then only restores `tools/workspace.html`
in its `finally` block — not the side effect that script run has on
`service-worker.js`'s own CACHE_NAME/fingerprint. Running the full suite
locally can leave `service-worker.js` genuinely modified (to a *correct*
value) afterward, and can make a handful of other "checks the real,
current repo" tests intermittently fail if they happen to run in that
window. Not a real bug in the app — just something to know before
concluding a full-suite failure is real: check whether it's one of the
"real, current codebase" self-check tests, and try it in isolation before
chasing it further.
